The objective of Image compression is to reduce the number of colors by using (k-Mean Clustering algorithm) by which the result look closest to the original Image. In This project, the file size was reduced by 71% from 228kb to 65kb with (k=20). If any one want to get a better intuition for this algorithm, they should try out different value of (k).
